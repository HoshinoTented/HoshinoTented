## Profile

An empty stack developer from China, programming as a hobby. Kid.

I am interested in...:

* Rust (Functional Programming, Native, Lifetime, Efficient, **FUN**)
* Scala (Functional Programming, JVM, **FUN**)
* Haskell (**Pure Functional Programming**, **FUN**)

I hate...:

* C++ (UB)
* Python (**DYNAMICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC**)
* JavaScript (**DYNAMIC**, but I hate Python more, because JavaScript has a number of **MAGIC**)

## About my ID? 

Hoshino("ÊòüÈáé" or "„Åª„Åó„ÅÆ" in Japanese) is a Japanese last name, and Tented("Â§©ÂøÜ" in Chinese) is a Chinese first name (even "Tented" has no any meaning in English though).

## Game?

I like **Minecraft**(prefer adding some mods, such as GregTech or Botania), ~~**Houkai Impact 3rd**~~, OSU!, Genshin and **Azur Land**.
