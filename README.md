## Profile

An empty stack developer from China, programming as a hobby. Student.

I am interested in...:
* Kotlin(JVM)
* Rust
* Scala
* Haskell

## About my ID? 

Hoshino("星野" or "ほしの" in Japanese) is a Japanese last name, and Tented("天忆" in Chinese) is a Chinese first name (even "Tented" has no any meaning in English though).

## Game?

I like **Minecraft**(prefer adding some mods, such as GregTech and Botania), **Houkai Impact 3rd**.and **Baba is you**.
